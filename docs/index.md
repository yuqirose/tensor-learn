# Welcome to Tensor-Learn
We held our very first [tensor-learn workshop](http://tensor-learn.org) at [NIPS](https://nips.cc/) 2016, one of the most prodigious conference in machine learning (ML) and AI. 
Many people asked for a pointer to learn about tensors. Here it is, an one-stop repo for learning about tensor methods.

### What is Tensor?
Tensor is high dimensional generalization of matrices.

### Why Tensor-Learn?

Accompanied by the resurgence of deep neural networks, tensor has become a critical mathematical tool to machine learning. If you heard about [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), you will get a glimpse of why tensors are important.   

But tensor methods go beyond TensorFlow, which by itself only treats tensor as a multi-dimensional array. The purpose of this repo is really to promote a *new way of computation*. If we think of [BLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas/) to accelerate the revolution from vectors to matrices, the era of tensors is coming!
