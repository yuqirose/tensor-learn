# Welcome to Tensor-Learn
In this blog, you will learn the recent development in tensor methods, especially with the application to machine learning.

### What is Tensor?
Tensor is high dimensional generalization of matrices. 

### Why Tensor-Learn?

Accompanied by the resurgence of deep neural networks, tensor has become a critical mathematical tool to machine learning. If you heard about [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), you will get a glimpse of why tensors are important.   

But tensor methods go beyond TensorFlow, which by itself only treats tensor as a multi-dimensional array. The purpose of this repo is really to promote a *new way of computation*. If we think of [BLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas/) to accelerate the revolution from vectors to matrices, the era of tensors is coming!
