# About Tensor-Learn
We held our very first [tensor-learn workshop](http://tensor-learn.org) at [NIPS](https://nips.cc/) 2016, one of the most prodigious conference in machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
Many people asked for a pointer to learn about tensors. The request motivates us to write an informal blog about tensor methods for machine learning. 
We hope our blog can make tensors more accessible to the general public, to assist breakthroughs in ML and AI.
