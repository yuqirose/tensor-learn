A new student in my lab asked me to give him a quick introduction to tensor for machine learning. My usual response to those kind of request is to google search and copy paste him an url. However, this time. I was stuck. There is no such url I can find. (With my trained information retrieval skills throughout PhD.) So I ended up giving him a 'chalk' talk on the blackboard. I figured that this request might not be unique and I can use my knowledge to contribute to the community. Here it is... A quick intro to tensor learning.",
