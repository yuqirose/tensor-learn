A new student in my lab asked me to give him a quick introduction to tensor for machine learning. My usual response to those kind of requests is to google search and share an url. However, this time. I was stuck. There was no such url I could find (with my trained information retrieval skills). So I ended up giving him a 'chalk' talk on the blackboard. I figured that this request might not be unique and I could use my knowledge to contribute to the community. Here it is...
